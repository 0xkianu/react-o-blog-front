React-O-Blog
Directions
Revenge of REACT-O-BLOG!
Your goal is to create a full-fledged PERN (PSQL, Express, React, Node) application, aka React-O-Blog!
You'll write a backend, using Node, Express, and PostgreSQL to serve as an API.
You'll write a frontend, in React.
The React app will talk to the backend and render the data from the API.
Perhaps a diary of learning React/Redux?

Day 14, I think the teacher has gone insane. I have no idea what is going on, send help!

NOTE: You'll run the backend and frontend in seperate folders/repos.

Your Backend JSON API
Create a Node + Express + PSQL app to store blog posts and comments
Have the routes return JSON: res.json([SOMEDATA]).status(200);
API Routes
Route to submit an entry
Route to serve up all all entries
Route to get a single entry
Your React Frontend
Create a React App to load data from the API
React Architecture
A component to submit an entry
A component to list all entries
A component to list a single entry
Routes to move between all entries and a single entry
Bonus
Authenticate a user.
You do not need to include authentication, it's a bonus!
Seriously, make this the last thing you incoporate. Make the other parts work first, then retrofit this as a BONUS.
Testing Requirement
Add a COMPONENT test 
Add a FEATURE test (aka "End-to-End")
